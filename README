# SB-Net
An architecture for identification of ILD
## Dataset
The dataset used in this study consists of 2D lung HRCT slices (2636 in total) and their corresponding labels. For, training and evaluation, the dataset was randomly shuffled and split into **train dataset (80%)**, and **test dataset (20%)**. The 80% training data, in each split, was further divided into
a **training set (95%)** and a **validation set (5%)**. We repeated three such independent random splits to ensure performance of our approach was evaluated across multiple, distinct data
distributions and remained stable and consistent. One such split will be made available upon reasonable request. 
The data will be structured as following -Data\
    Train set\
    Validation set\
    Test set

## Code
**Task** - Multi-label classification of 5 ILD patterns on HRCT slices (Consolidation, Emphysema, Fibrosis, GGO, Micro-Nodules).

**Approach** - The code defines a novel architecture SB-Net with four plug-and-play, modules - RSconv, SVconv, BM attention and RESP-(a pooling method). The actual implementation of these modules is currently a placeholder to demonstrate the overall structure. The complete implementation of the final working version will be made available upon reasonable request.

**Requirements** - Python 3.8.10 was used
PyTorch was used for training and evaluation.
The following packages were used in our implementation - glob, sys, os, numpy, matplotlib, torch, torchvision, torchsummary, captum.


The trained models will be made available upon reasonable request
